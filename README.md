# Caesar Engine
This engine has been built from the ground up to be a similar to Paradox Game's Clausewitz engine. It is designed for use on a more "fantastical setting" type of game, instead of the gorunded games Clausewitz is known for.

# Why the name?
Both the latin word for emperor, given to not only the rulers of the Roman Empire, but also to some later historical figures of grandure. It is also the name of a character who shall reamin private :3

# Compiling
To compile the engine (in linux), execute the command `bash compile.sh`. This script will use all cores available on your computer (except two, left so you may still use your computer) to compile the engine. The engine will be compiled to the `build` directory, and can be run by executing `./build/CaesarEngine` from the source dir.

# Usage
The following keys can be used to interact with the engine:
- `F5`: Activate wireframe mode
- `F6`: Deactivate wireframe mode
- `Scroll Wheel`: Zoom in and out
- `WASD`: Move the camera

# How to test
If you want to test Caesar Engine by yourself, click on the "Project build"
badge on the top of this page, and then click on the latest build. You will be
able to download a zip file containing the engine, which you can extract and run
easily. The executable file will be inside the `Release` folder, rememeber!
